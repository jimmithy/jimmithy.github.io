                Senior Director of Engineering at Hinge, where I lead growth engineering for one of the world's most downloaded dating apps. Over five years at Hinge I've driven initiatives that delivered 40% year-over-year revenue and user growth, launched new subscription tiers, and expanded the product into new countries and languages — helping Hinge reach the top three in core English-speaking markets and Northern Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before Hinge I spent nearly a decade at The Meet Group as Android Architect and Team Lead, growing the Android portfolio from a single app to a suite of social products with over 500 million combined downloads.

            <p>
                I've also been building Android <a href="apps/">apps</a> independently since 2009. Drinking Games hit one million downloads in its first ten months, retroPod went viral on TikTok and climbed to a top-three music app in South Korea, and Springdroid was acquired by myYearbook. A few of these have been <a href="writings.html#press">featured</a> in national advertising campaigns, international magazines, and popular tech publications.
