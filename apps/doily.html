                    As you start drawing, your lines are replicated to generate cool pieces of art. Adjust the number of segments, colors, shapes, and line widths to create your own one of a kind rangoli, mandala, or spirograph.

                    I saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/5al67o/amaziograph/" target="_blank">this post</a> on /r/whoadude about an app called Amaziograph and was impressed as someone threw together a javascript version within a few hours. Easily tempted, I spent a few nights coming up with an android version. Since it's release, I've been amazed by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/digitaldoily/" target="_blank">the fantastic works of art</a> created.
