                    I originally wrote a brick game for <a href="retropod.html">retropod</a> and realized that the scroll motion of the clickwheel is the same type of input as the rotary crown of my android wear watch.

                    There are not many games for Android Wear, so I decided to port the full experience as a standalone android wear app.
