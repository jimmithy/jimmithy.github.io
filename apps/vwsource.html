                    My first android application was to create the ability to view the source of a web page. With integration into the android browser, the user could enter a URL and the source of the page would be returned. The application was listed by Mashable as one of their top 5 apps for web developers and featured in .net Magazine issue #203 as one of the top 20 mobile applications for web developers.
