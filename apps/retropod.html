                    The app will show you all the music on your device, sorted by Artist, Album, and a list of all the songs. The click wheel works just like how you remember, with haptic feedback while scrolling. You can adjust the clickwheel clicker, shuffle songs, and/or repeat all options in the settings.

                    The app was built over Thanksgiving week 2019 after seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/elvin_not_11/status/1199717678908366854" target="_blank">this inspiration from @elvin_not_11</a>
