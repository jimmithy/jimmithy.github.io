                        Android developer with a diverse collection of applications available in the Google Play store, combining in over 40 million downloads. I have been fortunate enough to have some of these apps mentioned in national advertising campaigns, international magazines, and popular online websites. They have also previously been ranked in the top free and paid categories of the Google Play store, as well as in the trending section on the front page of the Play store website.
